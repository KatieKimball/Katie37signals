Katie37signals
==============
In this project, you’ll need to re-create the top section of the homepage for 37 Signals (everything up to the three gray asterisks). Don’t worry about the hover effects, because you’ll need JQuery for those (to come later). Like in the previous Google assignment, try to only look at the source code when you need to figure out whether they’ve used an image to implement something, or to get the fonts or colors; if you get stuck, feel free to check out their implementation though. Don’t worry about matching their font exactly; just pick something similar. If you’re still having some difficulties, see if you can get through the whole thing.

In your local Projects Folder, create a new directory to house this project.
Inside the directory you just made, create an index.html and main.css.
Again, in the same directory you made in step a, create a directory entitled “images”, which is where you’ll house the image files you copy and save from the original 37 Signals page.
Now work your magic, and turn those blank index.html and main.css pages into code that will reproduce a more or less faithful reproduction of the original!
Once your page is complete (and “complete” here need not mean perfect!), publish it on Dropbox, like you did with your Google clone: copy your site folder into your public Dropbox folder, then right click on index.html, and click "Copy Public Link".
Finally, post your project link in your Google+ community and solicit feedback from your classmates.
