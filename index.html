        		<h2>1</h2>
        		<h3>Useful is forever</h3>
        		<h5>Bells and whistles wear off, but usefulness never does. We build useful software that does just what you need and nothing you don't.</h5>

        		<h2>2</h2>
        		<h3>Great service is everything</h3>
				<h5>We're famous for fast and friendly customer service. We work hard to make sure we live up to that reputation every day. See how our customers rate our service.</h5>
				
				<h2>3</h2>
				<h3>Clarity is king</h3>
				<h5>Buzzwords, lingo, and sensationalized sales-and-marketing-speak have no place at 37signals. We communicate clearly and honestly.</h5>
				
				<h2>4</h2>
				<h3>Our customers are our investors</h3>
				<h5>Our customers fund our daily operations by paying for our products. We answer to them - not investors, the stock market, or a board of directors.</h5>
			</div>

			<div class="right">
				<h2>5</h2>
				<h3>The basics are beautiful</h3>
				<h5>We'll never overlook what really matters: The basics. Great service, ease of use, honest pricing, and respect for our customer's time, money, and trust.</h5>

				<h2>6</h2>
				<h3>No hidden fees or secret prices</h3>
				<h5>We believe everyone is entitled to the best price we can offer. Our prices are public, published right on our site, and the same no matter who you are.</h5>

				<h2>7</h2>
				<h3>Software should be easy</h3>
				<h5>Our products are intuitive. You'll pick them up in seconds or minutes, not hours, days or weeks. We don't sell you training because you don't need it.</h5>

				<h2>8</h2>
				<h3>Long-term contracts are obscene</h3>
				<h5>No one likes being locked into something they don't want anymore. Our customers can cancel at any time, no questions asked. No setup/termination fees either.</h5>

        		<h2>"REMOTE is the book that 21st century business leaders have been waiting for: a paradigm-smashing, compulsively readable case for a radically remote workplace. Not a day goes by that I don't think about, talk about, and actually apply the insights in this game-changing book."<h2>
        		<h5>— Susan Cain, New York Times bestselling author of Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking</h5>

        		<h2>"In the near future, everyone will work remotely, including those sitting across from you. You'll need this farsighted book to prepare for this inversion."</h2>

        		<h5>— Mark Cuban, co-founder HDNet, owner of the Dallas Mavericks</h5>

        		<h2>"The wisdom in these pages is edgy yet simple, straightforward, and proven. Read this book multiple times to help give you the courage you need to get out there and make something great."</h2>
        		<h5>— Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos.com</h5>
