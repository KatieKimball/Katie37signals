      <h2>We built the company that we'd want to do business with. We hope you do too.</h2>

      <div class="left">
        <h3>Useful is forever</h3>
        <h5>Bells and whistles wear off, but usefulness never does. We build useful software that does just what you need and nothing you don't.</h5>

        <h3>Great service is everything</h3>
        <h5>We're famous for fast and friendly customer service. We work hard to make sure we live up to that reputation every day. See how our customers rate our service.</h5>
        
        <h3>Clarity is king</h3>
        <h5>Buzzwords, lingo, and sensationalized sales-and-marketing-speak have no place at 37signals. We communicate clearly and honestly.</h5>

        <h3>Our customers are our investors</h3>
        <h5>Our customers fund our daily operations by paying for our products. We answer to them - not investors, the stock market, or a board of directors.</h5>
      </div>

      <div class="right">
        <h3>The basics are beautiful</h3>
        <h5>We'll never overlook what really matters: The basics. Great service, ease of use, honest pricing, and respect for our customer's time, money, and trust.</h5>

        <h3>No hidden fees or secret prices</h3>
        <h5>We believe everyone is entitled to the best price we can offer. Our prices are public, published right on our site, and the same no matter who you are.</h5>

        <h3>Software should be easy</h3>
        <h5>Our products are intuitive. You'll pick them up in seconds or minutes, not hours, days or weeks. We don't sell you training because you don't need it.</h5>

        <h3>Long-term contracts are obscene</h3>
        <h5>No one likes being locked into something they don't want anymore. Our customers can cancel at any time, no questions asked. No setup/termination fees either.</h5>
