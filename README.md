Katie37signals
==============
In this project, you’ll refactor the 37signals homepage clone you created earlier in the course. Specifically, you’ll need to reproduce the hover effects on the three boxes for Basecamp, Highrise, and Campfire, respectively.

Open your existing 37signals project. If you skipped that project, clone this Github repo to get the necessary code.
In your 37signals project directory, create a new file called application.js (you can choose a different file name, but it should end with “.js”). This file will contain the jQuery code you’re about to write.
Link to application.js in the <head> of your HTML document.
Add jQuery to the <head> of your HTML document (you can download it to your machine, or link to the version hosted by Google per their instructions).
Now the hard part! Write the necessary jQuery code in application.js and, if necessary, your css file to reproduce the hover behavior you see in the original.
Once you’ve got a version of the project you’re happy with, commit your changes and push to a gh-pages branch.
